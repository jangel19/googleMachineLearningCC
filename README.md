# Google Machine Learning Crash Course

**Author:** Jordi Lopez  
**Goal:** Build a deep, hands-on understanding of core Machine Learning concepts by recreating every lesson from Google’s *Machine Learning Crash Course* using my own IDE instead of Colab — focusing on code structure, reproducibility, and real-world engineering workflows.

## Overview

This repository contains my personal implementations of the **Google Machine Learning Crash Course** exercises.  
Each concept is written from scratch as an individual Python module, with clean plots, documentation, and metric visualizations.

Instead of running prebuilt notebooks, I’m writing everything in standalone `.py` scripts to:
- Strengthen my understanding of **how ML works under the hood**  
- Practice structuring ML projects for **production-level clarity**  
- Build habits in **version control, documentation, and reproducibility**

## Key Concepts Covered So Far

- **Linear Regression** – Gradient descent, learning rate tuning, and loss functions  
- **Logistic Regression** – Sigmoid function, binary classification, and thresholding  
- **Classification Metrics** –  
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
  - ROC and AUC  
  - Trade-offs between **false positives** and **false negatives**  
  - Threshold optimization and cost sensitivity

## Why I’m Doing This

My long-term goal is to become a **Machine Learning Engineer** focused on **quantitative finance** and **hedge-fund research**.  

By rebuilding Google’s ML course from scratch, I’m building a strong foundation in:
- Data preprocessing and model evaluation  
- Understanding probabilistic outcomes and prediction costs  
- Applying ML intuitively to real-world financial data
